I'm ready to assist you with this codebase.\n\nI understand that:\n\n- This is the **NotebookLM Re-Mastered** project - an open alternative to Google's NotebookLM\n- It's an API-first research intelligence platform currently in the specification phase\n- The architecture uses: **Next.js (Frontend) → Supabase (Auth + DB + Storage + Realtime) → Gemini API**\n- Key guidance includes using Supabase MCP for database/infrastructure and Chrome MCP for UI testing\n- I should proactively compact conversations after ~40-50 tool calls without asking\n\nI'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** and can:\n- Search files using glob patterns\n- Search code with regex patterns via grep\n- Read specific files\n- Run read-only bash commands\n\nI cannot:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run commands that change system state\n\nHow can I help you with this project? I'm ready to search the codebase, analyze specifications, or help you understand the current state of the implementation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2527,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":248,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWaivgATvdVWz2NFvePLA","type":"assistant","uuid":"33633d58-ddf9-4835-96c7-5b72a40c241f","timestamp":"2025-12-29T09:14:45.130Z"}
