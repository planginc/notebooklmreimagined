The automated backup system flickered, failed, then went dark. Marina smiled, struck a match, and lit the old oil lamp herself.\n\nAt dawn, a fishing boat captain knocked on her door. \"Your light saved us,\" he said. \"The electronic one died, but yours—yours stayed on.\"\n\nShe handed him a cup of tea. \"Some things,\" she said, \"still need a human touch.\"\n\n---\n\nWant a different genre?
